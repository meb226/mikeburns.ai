For more than 30 years, VSA has been developing and executing tailored government affairs strategies for clients ranging from Fortune 500 companies to small towns, research universities, and charitable organizations. Early on, VSA made a deliberate decision not to hire former Members of Congress, choosing instead to focus on the long game in Washington by assembling a deep, talented, bipartisan team of policy experts. This commitment has paid off: according to Bloomberg Government, VSA enjoys the highest ranking for client retention among its competitors. While growing into one of the most successful firms in D.C., we have never forgotten where we started, which is why every client continues to get the personal attention of a small, entrepreneurial company.\n\nThe right message, to the right person, at the right time."

In Washington today, influence is no longer wielded solely by a few powerful voices; it's just as likely to be molded by small groups of well-organized voices online, in the streets, or at town halls. That's why S-3 takes an integrated approach to every client's challenge, bringing together the power of subject matter expertise, reach, and experience with the latest stakeholder engagement methods. Our bipartisan team of senior strategists and operatives has decades of experience winning legislative, regulatory, and reputation battles, with strong relationships where it counts: Hill leadership, appropriators, key committees, the White House, and federal agencies. Founded by John Scofield, with partners regularly named among The Hill's Top Lobbyists, S-3 creates unprecedented influence for clients of all sizes."

In a city full of show horses, Lot Sixteen offers a different profile: an energetic and fearless team of lobbying and communications professionals who dig deep on policy and work as hard as the staffers we're trying to persuade. We've seen first-hand how deep issue expertise, paired with creative communications, can break down walls and advance agendas. If you want a firm with the guts, perspective, and maturity to give you an honest assessment of when, where, and how to invest\u2014and where not to\u2014you've found it."
